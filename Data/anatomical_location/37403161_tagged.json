  "tagged_abstract": "Braak's hypothesis states that sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) follows a specific progression of pathology from the @@peripheral## to the @@central## nervous system, and this progression can be monitored by detecting the\u00a0accumulation of alpha-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) protein. Consequently, there is\u00a0growing interest in understanding how the @@gut## (commensal) @@microbiome## can regulate \u03b1-Syn accumulation, as this could potentially lead to PD. We used 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing to characterise microbial diversity. <sup>1</sup>H-NMR was employed to understand the metabolite\u00a0production and intestinal inflammation estimated using ELISA and RNA-sequencing from feces and the\u00a0intestinal epithelial layer respectively. The\u00a0Na<sup>+</sup> channel current and @@gut## permeability were measured using an\u00a0Ussing chamber. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence imaging were applied to detect the\u00a0\u03b1-Syn protein. LC-MS/MS was used for characterization of proteins from metabolite treated neuronal cells. Finally, Metascape and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) bioinformatics tools were used for identification of dysregulated pathways. We studied a transgenic (TG) rat model overexpressing the human SNCA gene and found that a progressive @@gut## microbial composition alteration characterized by the reduction of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio could be detected in the young TG rats. Interestingly, this ratio then increased with ageing. The\u00a0dynamics of Lactobacillus and Alistipes were monitored and reduced Lactobacillus and increased Alistipes abundance was discerned in ageing TG rats. Additionally, the SNCA gene overexpression resulted in @@gut## \u03b1-Syn protein expression and increased with advanced age. Further, older TG animals had increased @@intestinal## inflammation, decreased Na<sup>+</sup> current and a robust alteration in metabolite production characterized by the increase of succinate levels in feces and serum. Manipulation of the @@gut## bacteria by short-term antibiotic cocktail\u00a0treatment revealed a complete loss of short-chain fatty acids and a\u00a0reduction in succinate levels. Although antibiotic\u00a0cocktail treatment did not change \u03b1-Syn expression in the @@enteric## nervous system of the @@colon##, however, reduced \u03b1-Syn expression was detected in the @@olfactory## bulbs (@@forebrain##) of the TG rats. Our data emphasize that the @@gut## microbiome dysbiosis synchronous with ageing leads to a specific alteration of @@gut## metabolites and can be modulated by antibiotics which may affect PD pathology."
