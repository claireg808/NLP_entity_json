  "tagged_abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that gut microbiota is important in the regulation of brain activity and @@cognitive functions##. Microbes mediate communication among the metabolic, peripheral immune, and central nervous systems via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, it is not well understood how the gut microbiome and neurons in the brain mutually interact or how these interactions affect normal brain functioning and @@cognition##. We summarize the mechanisms whereby the gut microbiota regulate the production, transportation, and functioning of neurotransmitters. We also discuss how microbiome dysbiosis affects @@cognitive function##, especially in @@neurodegenerative diseases## such as @@Alzheimer's disease## and @@Parkinson's disease##."
