  "tagged_abstract": "Depression is a common, severe and chronic @@psychiatric disease##. Although the currently available @@antidepressants## have been used in the treatment of @@depression##, their beneficial effects are limited. Accumulating evidence suggests that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) have an important role in the pathogenesis of @@depression##. This study was undertaken to examine whether anti-mouse IL-6 receptor antibody (MR16-1) induces @@antidepressant effects## in a social defeat stress model. Intravenous injection of MR16-1 induced rapid-onset and long-lasting @@antidepressant effects## in susceptible mice after social defeat stress through its anti-inflammatory actions. In contrast, intracerebroventricular injection of MR16-1 induced no @@antidepressant effects## in susceptible mice. Furthermore, treatment with MR16-1 could significantly normalize alterations in the expression of synaptic proteins (postsynaptic density protein 95 and \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor 1) and dendritic spine density in the brain regions of susceptible mice. Gut microbiota analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing showed that MR16-1 significantly improved decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in susceptible mice. It also significantly improved decreased levels of Oscillospira in susceptible mice. These findings suggest that peripheral IL-6 has a key role in the pathogenesis of @@depression## and that the blockade of IL-6 receptor in the periphery might have rapid-onset and long-lasting @@antidepressant effects## by normalizing the altered composition of gut microbiota in susceptible mice after social defeat stress. Therefore, the blockade of IL-6 receptor in the periphery shows promise as a novel therapeutic approach for @@depressed patients## with higher IL-6 blood levels."
