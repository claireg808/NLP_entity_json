  "tagged_abstract": "Alcohol-related morbidity may involve changes in the gut microbiota and @@immune dysregulation##. We have previously demonstrated alterations in gut microbiota composition and functions in patients with alcohol overconsumption, and now aimed to investigate possible associations between cytokine levels, gut microbiota, and @@clinical symptoms##. We included hospital inpatients with a history of @@chronic alcohol overconsumption##. For comparison, we included control patients with a low alcohol intake. Cytokine levels (TGF-\u03b21, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-1, IL-1RA, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-17) were determined using a customized V-plex assay. We then examined associations of cytokine levels with the abundance of Proteobacteria and Faecalibacterium, percentage of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, @@psychiatric symptoms## (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and @@biochemical liver variables##. We included 28 patients with alcohol overconsumption (79% men), and 25 control patients (72% men). Patients with alcohol overconsumption had higher levels of IL-6 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), IFN-\u03b3 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018), and MCP-1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), and lower levels of TGF-\u03b21 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) compared with control patients. Inverse correlations were found between Proteobacteria abundance and TNF-\u03b1 (R<sub>s</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0-0.55, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and IL-8 (R<sub>s</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0-0.58, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014), and between Faecalibacterium and MCP-1 levels (R<sub>s</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0-0.56, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) in the control patients, but not in patients with alcohol overconsumption. Patients with alcohol overconsumption reported more @@psychiatric symptoms##, and these symptoms were inversely correlated with IL-10 levels. There were positive correlations between several of the assessed cytokines and @@biochemical liver variables##, and negative correlations between cytokine levels and albumin. Patients with alcohol overconsumption had a cytokine profile suggestive of increased systemic @@inflammatory activity##, with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and MCP-1) and lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-\u03b21). The findings may represent a link between alcohol use and @@alcohol-related morbidity##."
