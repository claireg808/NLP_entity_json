  "tagged_abstract": "Visceral pain is a complex and heterogeneous disorder, which can range from the mild discomfort of indigestion to the agonizing pain of renal colic. Regulation of visceral pain involves the @@spinal cord## as well as higher order @@brain## structures. Recent findings have linked the @@gut## microbiota to @@gastrointestinal## disorders characterized by abdominal pain suggesting the ability of microbes to modulate visceral hypersensitivity and nociception to pain. In this review we describe the neuroanatomical basis of visceral pain signaling and the existing evidence of its manipulation exerted by the @@gut## microbiota. We included an updated overview of the potential therapeutic effects of dietary intervention, specifically probiotics and prebiotics, in alleviating hypersensitivity to visceral pain stimuli. The @@gut## microbiota dramatically impacts normal visceral pain sensation and affects the mechanisms mediating visceral nociception. Furthermore, manipulation of the @@gut## microbiota using prebiotics and probiotics plays a potential role in the regulation of visceral pain disorders."
