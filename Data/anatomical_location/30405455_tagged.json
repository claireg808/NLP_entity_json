  "tagged_abstract": "Advances in understanding the role of the @@microbiome## in physical and mental health are at the forefront of medical research and hold potential to have a direct impact on precision medicine approaches. In the past 7 years, we have studied the role of @@microbiota##-@@brain## communication on behavior in mouse models using germ-free mice, mice exposed to antibiotics, and healthy specific pathogen free mice. Through our work and that of others, we have seen an amazing increase in our knowledge of how bacteria signal to the @@brain## and the implications this has for psychiatry. @@Gut## @@microbiota## composition and function are influenced both by genetics, age, sex, diet, life experiences, and many other factors of psychiatric and bodily disorders and thus may act as potential biomarkers of the @@gut##-@@brain## axis that could be used in psychiatry and co-morbid conditions. There is a particular need in @@major depressive disorder## and other mental illness to identify biomarkers that can stratify patients into more homogeneous groups to provide better treatment and for development of new therapeutic approaches. Peripheral outcome measures of host-@@microbe## bidirectional communication have significant translational value as biomarkers. Enabling stratification of clinical populations, based on individual biological differences, to predict treatment response to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Here we consider the links between co-morbid @@metabolic syndrome## and @@depression##, focusing on biomarkers including leptin and ghrelin in combination with assessing @@gut## @@microbiota## composition, as a potential tool to help identify individual differences in depressed population."
