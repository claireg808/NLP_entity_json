  "tagged_abstract": "Sleep deprivation (SD) is increasingly common in modern society, which can lead to the dysregulation of inflammatory responses and @@cognitive impairment##, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and development of @@inflammatory## and @@psychiatric diseases##, possibly via gut microbiota-brain interactions and @@neuroinflammation##. The present study investigated the impact of SD on gut microbiota composition and explored whether alterations of the gut microbiota play a causal role in @@chronic inflammatory states## and @@cognitive impairment## that are induced by SD. We found that SD-induced @@gut dysbiosis##, inflammatory responses, and @@cognitive impairment## in humans. Moreover, the absence of the gut microbiota suppressed inflammatory response and @@cognitive impairment## induced by SD in germ-free (GF) mice. Transplantation of the \"SD microbiota\" into GF mice activated the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling pathway and impaired @@cognitive function## in the recipient mice. Mice that harbored \"SD microbiota\" also exhibited increases in @@neuroinflammation## and microglial activity in the @@hippocampus## and @@medial prefrontal cortex##. These findings indicate that @@gut dysbiosis## contributes to both @@peripheral## and @@central inflammatory processes## and @@cognitive deficits## that are induced by SD, which may open avenues for potential interventions that can relieve the detrimental consequences of sleep loss."
