  "tagged_abstract": "The impact of the gut microbiome is being increasingly appreciated in health and in various @@chronic diseases##, among them @@neurodegenerative disorders## such as @@Parkinson's disease (PD)##. In the @@pathogenesis## of @@PD##, the role of the gut has been previously established. In conjunction with a better understanding of the intestinal microbiome, a link to the misfolding and spread of alpha-synuclein via inflammatory processes within the gut is discussed. In a case-control study, we assessed the gut microbiome of 54 @@PD patients## and 32 @@healthy controls (HC)##. Additionally, we tested in this proof-of-concept study whether dietary intervention alone or additional physical colon cleaning may lead to changes of the gut microbiome in @@PD##. 16 @@PD patients## underwent a well-controlled balanced, ovo-lacto vegetarian diet intervention including short fatty acids for 14 days. 10 of those patients received additional treatment with daily fecal enema over 8 days. Stool samples were collected before and after 14 days of intervention. In comparison to @@HC##, we could confirm previously reported @@PD associated microbiome changes##. The @@UDPRS III## significantly improved and the @@levodopa-equivalent daily dose## decreased after vegetarian diet and fecal enema in a one-year follow-up. Additionally, we observed a significant association between the gut microbiome diversity and the @@UPDRS III## and the abundance of <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>. Additionally, the abundance of <i>Clostridiaceae</i> was significantly reduced after enema. Dietary intervention and bowel cleansing may provide an additional non-pharmacologic therapeutic option for @@PD patients##."
