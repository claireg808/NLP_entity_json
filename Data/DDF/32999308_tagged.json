  "tagged_abstract": "The proper communication between gut and brain is pivotal for the maintenance of health and, dysregulation of the gut-brain axis can lead to several clinical disorders. In @@Parkinson's disease (PD)## 85% of all patients experienced constipation many years before showing any signs of motor phenotypes. For differential diagnosis and preventive treatment, there is an urgent need for the identification of biomarkers indicating early disease stages long before the disease phenotype manifests. DJ-1 is a chaperone protein involved in the protection against @@Parkinson's disease## and genetic mutations in this protein have been shown to cause familial @@Parkinson's disease##. However, how the deficiency of DJ-1 influences the risk of @@Parkinson's disease## remains incompletely understood. In the present study, we provide evidence that DJ-1 is implicated in shaping the gut microbiome including; their metabolite production, @@inflammation## and @@innate immune cells (ILCs) development##. We revealed that deficiency of DJ-1 leads to a significant increase in two specific genera/species, namely @@Alistipes## and @@Rikenella##. In DJ-1 knock-out (DJ-1<sup>-/-</sup>) mice the production of fecal @@calprotectin## and @@MCP-1 inflammatory proteins## were elevated. Fecal and serum metabolic profile showed that @@malonate## which influences the immune system was significantly more abundant in DJ-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. DJ-1 appeared also to be involved in @@ILCs development##. Further, @@inflammatory genes## related to @@Parkinson's disease## were augmented in the midbrain of DJ-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our data suggest that @@metabolites## and @@inflammation## produced in the gut could be used as @@biomarkers## for @@Parkinson's disease detection##. Perhaps, these @@metabolites## and @@inflammatory mediators## could be involved in triggering @@inflammation## resulting in @@Parkinson's disease pathology##."
