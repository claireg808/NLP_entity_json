  "tagged_abstract": "PLX5622, a @@brain##-penetrant highly specific inhibitor of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), is used to eliminate microglia in the @@brain##. Considering the role of microglia and @@gut## microbiota in the @@brain## homeostasis, this study was undertaken to investigate whether repeated intragastric administration of PLX5622 (65\u00a0mg/kg/day for consecutive 7\u00a0days) could affect the composition of @@gut## microbiota and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in fresh feces of adult mice. Repeated administration of PLX5622 caused significant reductions of the expression of genes and proteins for microglial markers in the @@prefrontal cortex## (PFC) and @@hippocampus## compared to control mice although the elimination of @@brain##'s microglia was partial. There was a significant alteration in the \u03b2-diversity of @@intestine## microbiota in the PLX5622-treated group. Linear discriminant analysis effect size identified eight significant enriched bacteria as microbial markers for PLX5622-treated group. Repeated administration of PLX5622 affected the relative abundance of several bacteria at the genus and species levels. Furthermore, repeated administration of PLX5622 caused a significant change in lactic acid compared to control group. Interestingly, we found significant correlations between microglial markers in the @@brain## and the relative abundance of several bacteria, suggesting microbiome-microglia crosstalk through the @@brain##-@@gut## axis. These data demonstrate that repeated administration of PLX5622 leads to an abnormal composition of the @@gut## microbiota and lactic acid in adult mice. Therefore, abnormalities in the composition of @@gut## microbiota after repeated treatment of PLX5622 should be considered for behavioral and biological functions in animals treated with CSF1R inhibitors."
