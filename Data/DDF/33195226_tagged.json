  "tagged_abstract": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a @@psychiatric disorder## that constitutes one of the top 10 global causes of @@disability##. More recently, a potential @@pathogenic role## for the gut microbial community (microbiota) has been highlighted, with numerous studies describing dysregulated microbial profiles in @@SZ patients## when compared to healthy controls. However, no animal model of @@SZ## has previously recapitulated the @@gut dysbiosis## observed clinically. Since the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) knockout mice provide a preclinical model of @@SZ## with strong face and predictive validity, in the present study we performed @@gut microbiome profiling## of mGlu5 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice by 16S rRNA sequencing of bacterial genomic DNA from fecal samples, analyzing bacterial diversity and taxonomic composition, as well as @@gastrointestinal parameters## as indicators of gut function. We found a significant genotype difference in microbial @@beta diversity##. Analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) models were performed to evaluate microbiota compositions, which identified a decreased relative abundance of the <i>Erysipelotrichaceae</i> family and <i>Allobaculum</i> genus in this mouse model of @@SZ##. We also identified a signature of bacteria discriminating between the genotypes (KO and WT), consisting of the Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales orders and @@macroscopic gut differences##. We thus uncovered global differential community composition in the @@gut microbiota profile## between mGlu5 KO and WT mice, outlining the first evidence for @@gut dysbiosis## in a genetic animal model of @@SZ##. Our findings suggest that this widely used preclinical model of @@SZ## also has substantial utility for investigations of @@gut dysbiosis## and associated signaling via the @@microbiota-gut-brain axis##, as potential modulators of @@SZ pathogenesis##. Our discovery opens up new avenues to explore @@gut dysbiosis## and its proposed links to @@brain dysfunction## in @@SZ##, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this @@devastating disorder##."
