  "tagged_abstract": "The @@gut## @@microbiota## plays a role in @@gut##-@@brain## communication and can influence psychological functioning. Diet is one of the major determinants of @@gut## @@microbiota## composition. The impact of unpasteurised dairy products on the @@microbiota## is unknown. In this observational study, we investigated the effect of a dietary change involving intake of unpasteurised dairy on @@gut## @@microbiome## composition and psychological status in participants undertaking a residential 12-week cookery course on an organic farm. Twenty-four participants completed the study. The majority of food consumed during their stay originated from the organic farm itself and included unpasteurised milk and dairy products. At the beginning and end of the course, participants provided faecal samples and completed self-report questionnaires on a variety of parameters including mood, anxiety and sleep. Nutrient intake was monitored with a food frequency questionnaire. @@Gut## @@microbiota## analysis was performed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, faecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured. Relative abundance of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> increased significantly between pre- and post-course time points. This increase was associated with participants intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products. An increase in the faecal SCFA, valerate, was observed along with an increase in the functional richness of the @@microbiome## profile, as determined by measuring the predictive neuroactive potential using a @@gut##-@@brain## module approach. While concerns in relation to safety need to be considered, intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products appear to be associated with the growth of the probiotic bacterial genus, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, in the @@human gut##. More research is needed on the effect of dietary changes on @@gut## @@microbiome## composition, in particular in relation to the promotion of bacterial genera, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i>, which are recognised as being beneficial for a range of physical and mental health outcomes."
