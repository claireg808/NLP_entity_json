  "tagged_abstract": "Physical and mental health is dependent on the environment, and feeding is a prime example of this environmental exchange. While the hypothalamus controls both feeding behavior and the stress response, the integration of the neural control centers and the peripheral @@gut## allows for disruption in the @@gastrointestinal## systems and dysfunctional communication to the @@brain##. The purpose of this review is to familiarize clinicians with the physiology controlling feeding behavior and its implications for psychiatric conditions, such as anorexia nervosa and depression. Growing understanding of how integrated bacterial life is in the body has shown that @@gut## bacteria regulate basic physiologic processes and are implicated in various disease states and contribute to regulation of mood. Responses to stress have effects on feeding behavior and mood and the regulation of the stress response by the @@gut## @@microbiota## could contribute to the dysfunction seen in patients with psychiatric illnesses. @@Gut## @@microbiota## may contribute to dysfunction in psychiatric illnesses. New opportunities to modulate existing @@gut## @@microbiota## using probiotics could be novel targets for clinical interventions."
