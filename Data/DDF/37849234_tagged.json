  "tagged_abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a complex @@neurodegenerative disorder## leading to a decline in cognitive function and mental health. Recent research has positioned the gut microbiota as an important susceptibility factor in @@Alzheimer's disease## by showing specific alterations in the gut microbiome composition of @@Alzheimer's patients## and in rodent models. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are causal in the manifestation of @@Alzheimer's symptoms##. To understand the involvement of @@Alzheimer's patient## gut microbiota in host physiology and behaviour, we transplanted faecal microbiota from @@Alzheimer's patients## and age-matched healthy controls into microbiota-depleted young adult rats. We found impairments in behaviours reliant on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, an essential process for certain memory functions and mood, resulting from @@Alzheimer's patient## transplants. Notably, the severity of impairments correlated with clinical cognitive scores in donor patients. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were also evident. As hippocampal neurogenesis cannot be measured in living humans but is modulated by the circulatory systemic environment, we assessed the impact of the @@Alzheimer's## systemic environment on proxy neurogenesis readouts. Serum from @@Alzheimer's patients## decreased neurogenesis in human cells in vitro and were associated with cognitive scores and key microbial genera. Our findings reveal for the first time, that @@Alzheimer's symptoms## can be transferred to a healthy young organism via the gut microbiota, confirming a causal role of gut microbiota in @@Alzheimer's disease##, and highlight hippocampal neurogenesis as a converging central cellular process regulating systemic circulatory and gut-mediated factors in @@Alzheimer's##."
