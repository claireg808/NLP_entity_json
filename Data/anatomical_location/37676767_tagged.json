  "tagged_abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by motor dysfunction, dopaminergic neuron loss, and alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) inclusions. Many PD risk factors are known, but those affecting disease progression are not. Lifestyle and microbial dysbiosis are candidates in this context. Diet-driven @@gut## dysbiosis and reduced barrier function may increase exposure of enteric neurons to toxins. Here, we study whether fiber deprivation and exposure to bacterial curli, a protein cross-seeding with \u03b1Syn, individually or together, exacerbate disease in the enteric and central nervous systems of a transgenic PD mouse model. We analyze the @@gut## microbiome, motor behavior, and gastrointestinal and @@brain## pathologies. We find that diet and bacterial curli alter the @@gut## microbiome and exacerbate motor performance, as well as intestinal and @@brain## pathologies, but to different extents. Our results shed important insights on how diet and microbiome-borne insults modulate PD progression via the @@gut##-@@brain## axis and have implications for lifestyle management of @@Parkinson's disease##."
