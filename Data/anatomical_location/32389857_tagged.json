  "tagged_abstract": "There is increasing interest in the role of the @@gut microbiota## in health and disease. In particular, @@gut microbiota## influences the @@Central Nervous System (CNS)## development and homeostasis through neural pathways or routes involving the @@immune## and @@circulatory systems##. The @@CNS##, in turn, shapes the @@intestinal flora## through @@endocrine## or @@stress-mediated responses##. These overall bidirectional interactions, known as @@gut microbiota-brain axis##, profoundly affect some brain functions, such as @@neurogenesis## and the production of @@neurotransmitters##, up to influence behavioral aspects of healthy subjects. Consequently, a dysfunction within this axis, as observed in case of @@dysbiosis##, can have an impact on the behavior of a given individual (e.g. @@anxiety## and @@depression##) or on the development of pathologies affecting the @@CNS##, such as @@autism spectrum disorders## and @@neurodegenerative diseases## (e.g. @@Alzheimer's disease## and @@Parkinson's disease##). It should be considered that the whole @@microbiota## has a significant role not only on aspects concerning @@human## physiology, such as harvesting of @@nutrients## and @@energy## from the ingested food or production of a wide range of @@bioactive compounds##, but also has positive effects on the @@gastrointestinal barrier function## and actively contributes to the @@pharmacokinetics## of several compounds including @@neuropsychiatric drugs##. Indeed, the @@microbiota## is able to affect @@drug absorption## and @@metabolism## up to have an impact on @@drug activity## and/or @@toxicity##. On the other hand, @@drugs## are able to shape the @@human gut microbiota## itself, where these changes may contribute to their @@pharmacologic profile##. Therefore, the emerging picture on the complex @@drug-microbiota## bidirectional interplay will have considerable implications in the future not only in terms of @@clinical practice## but also, upstream, on @@drug development##."
