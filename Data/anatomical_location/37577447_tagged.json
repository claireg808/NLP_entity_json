  "tagged_abstract": "The relationship between @@oral## and @@gut## microbiota in alcohol dependence (AD) is not well understood, particularly the effects of oral microbiota on the @@intestinal## microbiota. The current study aimed to explore the association between @@oral## and @@gut## microbiota in AD to clarify whether oral microbiota could ectopically colonize into the @@gut##. 16S rRNA sequence libraries were used to compare @@oral## and @@gut## microbial profiles in persons with AD and healthy controls (HC). Source Tracker and NetShift were used to identify bacteria responsible for ectopic colonization and indicate the driver function of ectopic colonization bacteria. The \u03b1-diversity of @@oral## microbiota and @@intestinal## microbiota was significantly decreased in persons with AD (all <i>p</i> <\u20090.05). Principal coordinate analysis indicated greater similarity between @@oral## and @@gut## microbiota in persons with AD than that in HC, and @@oral##-@@gut## overlaps in microbiota were found for 9 genera in persons with AD relative to only 3 genera in HC. The contribution ratio of @@oral## microbiota to @@intestinal## microbiota composition in AD is 5.26% based on Source Tracker\uff0cand the AD with ectopic colonization showed the daily maximum standard drinks, red blood cell counts, hemoglobin content, and PACS scores decreasing (all <i>p</i> <\u20090.05). Results highlight the connection between @@oral##-@@gut## microbiota in AD and suggest novel potential mechanistic possibilities."
