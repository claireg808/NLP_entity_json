  "tagged_abstract": "Infectious agents have been long considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases as part of the interaction between genetic susceptibility and the environment. The role of bacteria in @@CNS## autoimmunity has also been highlighted by changes in the diversity of @@gut## microbiota in patients with neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease and multiple sclerosis, emphasizing the role of the @@gut##-@@brain## axis. We discuss the hypothesis of a brain microbiota, the BrainBiota: bacteria living in symbiosis with brain cells. Existence of various bacteria in the @@human brain## is suggested by morphological evidence, presence of bacterial proteins, metabolites, transcripts and mucosal-associated invariant T cells. Based on our data, we discuss the hypothesis that these bacteria are an integral part of @@brain## development and immune tolerance as well as directly linked to the @@gut## microbiome. We further suggest that changes of the BrainBiota during @@brain## diseases may be the consequence or cause of the chronic inflammation similarly to the @@gut## microbiota."
