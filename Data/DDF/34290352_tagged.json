  "tagged_abstract": "The alterations in the gut microbiota have been reported to be correlated with the development of @@depression##. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes of intestinal microbiota in @@depressed## patients after @@antidepressant## treatment. We recruited 30 @@MDD## patients (MDD group) and 30 healthy controls (control group). The @@MDD## group received individualized treatment with escitalopram at a maximum dose of 20\u00a0mg/day. After depressive symptoms improved to a HAMD scale score\u2009>\u200950%, a fecal sample was collected again and used as the follow-up group. The differences of gut microbiota between patients and controls, the characteristics of gut microbiota under treatment and the potential differences in metabolic functions were thus investigated. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly different within three groups, and the ratio of follow-up group was significantly lower than those of the other two groups. Alpha diversity was significantly higher in @@MDD## group than those of the other groups, and the alpha diversity was not significantly different between control and follow-up groups. The beta diversity of some patients resembled participants in the control group. The metabolic function of gut microbiota after treatment was still different from that of the control group. This study suggests that the intestinal flora of @@depressed## patients has a tendency to return to normal under @@escitalopram## treatment."
