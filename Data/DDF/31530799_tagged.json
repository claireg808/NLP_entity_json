  "tagged_abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that abnormalities in the composition of gut microbiota might play a role in @@stress-related disorders##. In the learned helplessness (LH) paradigm, ~60-70% rats are susceptible to @@LH## in the face of inescapable electric stress. The role of gut microbiota in susceptibility in the @@LH paradigm## is unknown. In this study, male rats were exposed to inescapable electric stress under the @@LH paradigm##. The compositions of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids were assessed in fecal samples from control rats, @@non-LH (resilient) rats##, and @@LH (susceptible) rats##. Members of the order Lactobacillales were present at significantly higher levels in the @@susceptible rats## than in @@control## and @@resilient rats##. At the family level, the number of Lactobacillaceae in the @@susceptible rats## was significantly higher than in @@control## and @@resilient rats##. At the genus level, the numbers of @@Lactobacillus##, @@Clostridium cluster III##, and @@Anaerofustis## in @@susceptible rats## were significantly higher than in @@control## and @@resilient rats##. Levels of acetic acid and propionic acid in the feces of @@susceptible rats## were lower than in those of @@control## and @@resilient rats##; however, the levels of lactic acid in the @@susceptible rats## were higher than those of @@control## and @@resilient rats##. There was a positive correlation between lactic acid and @@Lactobacillus## levels among these three groups. These findings suggest that abnormal composition of the gut microbiota, including organisms such as @@Lactobacillus##, contributes to @@susceptibility## versus @@resilience## to @@LH## in rats subjected to inescapable electric foot shock. Therefore, it appears likely that @@brain-gut axis## plays a role in @@stress susceptibility## in the @@LH paradigm##."
