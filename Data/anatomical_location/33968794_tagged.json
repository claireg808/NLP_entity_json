  "tagged_abstract": "Several studies have highlighted the roles played by the @@gut microbiome## in @@central nervous system## diseases. Clinical symptoms and neuropathology have suggested that @@Parkinson's disease## may originate in the @@gut##, which is home to approximately 100 trillion microbes. Alterations in the @@gastrointestinal## microbiota populations may promote the development and progression of @@Parkinson's disease##. Here, we reviewed existing studies that have explored the role of @@intestinal dysbiosis## in @@Parkinson's disease##, focusing on the roles of microbiota, their metabolites, and components in inflammation, @@barrier failure##, @@microglial activation##, and \u03b1-synuclein pathology. We conclude that there are @@intestinal dysbiosis## in @@Parkinson's disease##. @@Intestinal dysbiosis## is likely involved in the pathogenesis of @@Parkinson's disease## through mechanisms that include @@barrier destruction##, inflammation and oxidative stress, decreased @@dopamine## production, and molecular mimicry. Additional studies remain necessary to explore and verify the mechanisms through which dysbiosis may cause or promote @@Parkinson's disease##. Preclinical studies have shown that @@gastrointestinal## microbial therapy may represent an effective and novel treatment for @@Parkinson's disease##; however, more studies, especially clinical studies, are necessary to explore the curative effects of microbial therapy in @@Parkinson's disease##."
