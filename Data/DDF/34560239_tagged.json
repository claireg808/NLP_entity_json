  "tagged_abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests the role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in the pathogenesis of @@Parkinson's disease## (PD). The objective of this study was to examine whether repeated administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) can influence the @@neurotoxicity## in the @@striatum## and @@colon##, and the composition of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces of adult mice. MPTP caused the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the @@striatum##, and increases in phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein (p-\u03b1-Syn) in the @@striatum## and @@colon##. There was a negative correlation between the expression of TH in the @@striatum## and the expression of p-\u03b1-Syn in the @@colon##, suggesting a role of gut-brain communication. MPTP caused abnormalities in the \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity of gut microbiota in the mice. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena in the MPTP-treated group was significantly lower than that of control group. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between the genus Faecalicatena and the expression of TH in the @@striatum##. Moreover, MPTP did not alter the levels of SCFAs in feces samples. However, there was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena and propionic acid. The data suggest that MPTP-induced increases in colonic p-\u03b1-Syn expression might be associated with @@dopaminergic neurotoxicity## in the @@striatum## via gut-microbiota-brain axis."
